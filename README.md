## Hi there 👋

I am a devoted Game Developer creating his own games.
I am an Indie developer.

I really adore horror games and its pyschological background of its atmosphere. 
I especially enjoy the lore behind it all and the way it happened to be in the first place.

Currently I am working on: "Dark Descent 1". Its a horror game I have always wanted to make ever since the day I start coding.
Its my reason to keep going the path I am going now currently.

What I enjoy in my free time: I watch anime here and there whenever a specific anime catches my interest. I also enjoy playing the piano inwhich I have been getting pretty good at.
